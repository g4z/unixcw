unixcw (3.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for PulseAudio, which should be a good news for users
    of the package on Ubuntu.
  * Implemented run-time linking of audio libraries decreases dependency
    on libasound (and from this release on libpulse) from 'requires' to
    'recommends'.
  * Added following flags to configure.ac:
    --disable-{console|oss|alsa|pulseaudio|cwcp|xcwcp}.
    "--disable-console" may help to compile unixcw on hurd-i386.
  * cwcp no longer limits gap to 20, currently the limit (imposed by
    libcw) is 60. Closes: #237891
  * It has been tested and confirmed that after applying available patch,
    and after redesign of OSS code, volume mixer is no longer muted at
    exit of cw or cwcp. Closes: #567394
  * It has been tested and confirmed that after applying available patch,
    and after redesign of OSS code, unixcw applications no longer use
    SOUND_MIXER_PCM ioctl, and so the problem described in #567392
    disappeared. Closes: #567392

unixcw (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream. Some comments by the author follows below.
  * An occurrence but not problem, presumably. Closes: #229690.
  * The gap now limits at 80 dots. Closes: #237981.
  * Dictionaries are fully configurable using files read at program
    startup. Closes: #239001.
  * Probably unavoidable.  To track CW speeds, the program needs to
    see a differential between dot and dash.  If fed only, say, dots, it has no
    way of telling if these are dots or dashes, so cannot vary or auto-determine
    speeds. Closes: #261729.
  * I couldn't tell if this was a joke report.  I could put a blank
    entry in the table, one side containing an ASCII ' ' and the other containing
    its representation in dots and dashes as " ", but it wouldn't look useful.
    Or perhaps I misread the request? Closes: #229694.
  * Fixed by holding the soundcard open in cwlib for ~10 seconds of inactivity.
    Closes: #230579.
  * Other bugs fixed. Closes: #231418, #236415, #222128, #232481, #261731, #292395.
  * I thought about this, and it's surprisingly hard, given the architecture
    of cwlib. The library's really only happy talking to a genuine sound
    device. Closes: #222432.
  * The 4WPM minimum is a careful balance between putting only a
    second or so of audio data into the sound card and ensuring it doesn't run
    out of data during the longest (dash) element.  Less than 4 is tricky.  Well,
    3 might just be doable, but 2 is out, and frankly, anything less than 4 loses
    the rhythm to the point where it's not really usable anyway. So, rejected.
    Closes: #241973.
  * Not done by xcwcp because it's really a tutor, not a reader
    program.  Adding this would bring in a whole slew of software tone filtering
    issues.  This is just the type of program that one could write around cwlib,
    though, so feel free to go for it!  (In fact I have a prototype from several
    years ago that reads raw audio files, finds tone edges, and then has a go at
    printing out CW read from it -- perhaps I should dust it off..).
    Closes: #263356.
  * Bugs not tackled: 222010, 222126, 236411, 261730, 261732.

unixcw (2.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * xcwcp: overwrite the createPopupMenu method and delete the popup menu
    when right-clicking the main window. This way we can use the right-mouse
    button for dah's (left button is for dit's).
  * xcwcp: make sure it all works without a mouse. A label called 'Mode'
    was added just before the QComboBox mode selection widget. The combo
    widget can get focus by using Alt+m. You can then use the space bar or the
    up/down keys to change the mode. The Tab key moves to the next widget, so
    you can change speed, etc. Shift+Tab moves backwards. Closes: #230298.
  * As a consequence of this, Ctrl and Shift key's have been disabled as
    paddles, this would interfere with keyboard control of the program.
    Please use left and right cursor keys.
  * Some changes to the xcwcp manual page to reflect all this. Thanks again
    to Dan for the report.

    edit window instead of the scrollwindow. Closes: #230886.
  * Bugs reported by Dan Jacobson. Thanks!

unixcw (2.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring back the old behaviour we had with Qt2: when first started, xcwcp
    will show the go button, when clicked, the stop button appears.
    QIconSet now contains both start and stop pixmaps, this behaviour
    needed for Qt3. Closes: #220350.
  * This also removes the first error seen at startup:
    "QToolButton::setOnIconSet(): This function is not supported anymore".
    The other error reported by Dan: "QSettings::sync: filename is
    null/empty" means you don't have write permissions to your ~/.qt
    directory. If you fix this, the error will dissapear. Closes: #220352.
  * The bug reported by Dan as: "/usr/bin/cw: hear a few chars, then poops
    out" most probably related to the sound card driver. I have tested unixcw
    with different systems and simple cannot reproduce this behaviour. As
    Dan reports: with alsa properly installed, the program behaves correctly.
    Closes: #218556.
  * Both errors reported by Dan concerning the cw.1 and cw.7 manpages are
    related to language settings, which are not able to display iso8859-1
    accented characters. To properly display these manual pages, you must
    configure your environment, so they can display accented characters.
    Try setting LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1 or similar and make sure to generate
    that locale using 'dpkg-reconfigure locales'. Closes: #218555, #218554.
  * Correct an error in cw.1 manpage to show correct timings when testing
    itimer. Closes: #222129.
  * Append a newline when cw exits. Closes: #222415.
  * Thanks to Dan Jacobson <jidanni@jidanni.org>, for reporting all these
    bugs. It is much appreciated. In the next upload I will address the
    remaining wishlist items or forward them to the upstream author.

    in the md5sums control file which did not exist.
