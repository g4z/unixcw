Template: cwcp/suid_bit
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Run cwcp with root privileges?
 If it is run with elevated privileges (which is not recommended), cwcp
 can produce sounds using the console buzzer.
 .
 Please choose whether this should be achieved by giving the
 executable the "setuid" attribute.
 .
 Alternatives include running the program with sudo or eliminating this
 issue completely by using output via a sound card instead of the
 buzzer.
