Thanks to...

Kamal Mostafa, KA6MAL, for reviewing the libcw API, showing me the errors of my
ways with 64-bit integers, and hounding me to add the adaptive receive speed
tracking...

Joop Stakenborg, PG4I, for being a willing "guinea pig" with various snapshots
of unfinished versions of the package, for help in isolating various sound card
problems, and for his continued enthusiasm and interest in maintaining UnixCW
as a Debian Linux package...

Paolo Cravero, IK1ZYW, for very kindly making the first sound card patch
available for UnixCW 2.  His tone generation code is now fully embedded inside
the CW library, and it's no exaggeration to say that without his help, there
would still be no sound card support in UnixCW...

Michael D. Ivey, for identifying a problem with CW sending rhythm when sending
in 'Farnsworth' mode, and for taking the time and trouble to test the patches
I sent him...

Wolf-Ruediger Juergens, for ideas on implementing CW weighting...

Diane Bruce and Jason L. Wright, for adding support for assorted BSD flavors...

Dan Jacobson, for making improvement suggestions above and beyond the call of
duty...

And finally, everyone else who has sent feedback about UnixCW.  If not for your
interest, and fairly frequent requests for a version that works with a sound
card, the package would not have progressed at all.
