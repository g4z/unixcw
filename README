This is README file for unixcw project.

unixcw is a project providing libcw library and a set of programs
using the library: cw, cwgen, cwcp and xcwcp. The programs are
intended for people who want to learn receiving and sending Morse
code. unixcw is developed and tested primarily on GNU/Linux system.

The heart of the unixcw package is libcw library.  It offers the
following basic CW services to a caller program:

 - Morse code character translation tables, and lookup functions
 - Morse code low-level timing calculations
 - A 'sidetone' generation and queueing system, using either the system sound
   card or the console speaker
 - Optional keying control for an external device, say a transmitter, or an
   oscillator
 - CW character and string send routines, tied in with the character lookup
 - CW receive routines, also tied in to the character lookup
 - Adaptive speed tracking of received CW
 - An iambic keyer, with both Curtis 8044 types A and B timing
 - Straight key emulation





The library uses signals and threads to create a background task in
which it performs the majority of its work, leaving the main program
free to handle other tasks.  For example, the simplest CW sending
program that uses the library looks like this (compile it with
"gcc -lcw example.c"):


#include <libcw.h>

int main ()
{
        /* Library initialization */
        cw_generator_new(CW_AUDIO_SOUNDCARD, NULL);
        cw_generator_start();

        /* Start the string sending in the background. */
        cw_send_string("Hello, world");

        /* Wait for the string send to complete. */
        cw_wait_for_tone_queue();

        /* Library cleanup */
        cw_generator_stop();
        cw_generator_delete();

        return 0;
}


Instead of the cw_wait_for_tone_queue() call, this program could
instead handle any other work it has to do, asynchronously from the CW
library's sending.

As well as the handful of applications included in unixcw, the
following types of programs might also use libcw as their core:

 - a fully graphical CW send and receive station
 - a 'CWbiff' that announces incoming email sender in CW
 - an offline CW reader program, capable of decoding CW from MP3 or
   other audio file formats
 - a simple Iambic keyer for an external transmitter, using the mouse
   buttons as the keyer paddles
 - a more comprehensive CW tutor program
 - an automated Morse Code testing application

libcw is written in C for easy portability and use.





In addition to libcw, the package comes with four basic applications:

 - cw: a CW sending 'engine' that reads characters from stdin, sounds
   them on either the sound card or the console speaker, and echoes
   them to stdout.

 - cwgen: a simple random character generator that can be used as a
   feed for cw.  For example:

               cwgen | cw

 - cwcp: a curses-based program that generates groups of characters
   from selected sets, words, and CW abbreviations randomly, and
   sounds them using libcw.  It owes much to CP222.EXE, by VU2ZAP.

 - xcwcp: a CW tutor program for X Window environment.  It offers the
   same random and keyboard sending as 'cwcp', and in addition can
   read CW that sent to it using the keyboard or mouse as a keyer,
   making it useful for sending as well as receiving practice.

Primary development platform for unixcw is Debian GNU/Linux. An effort
has been made to compile and test at least parts of some versions of
unixcw package on following platforms:
 - FreeBSD 9.3
 - FreeBSD 10.0
 - OpenBSD 5.5
 - Alpine Linux 3.1
