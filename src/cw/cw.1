\fBcw\fP installed on GNU/Linux systems understands both short form
and long form command line options.  \fBcw\fP installed on other
operating systems may understand only the short form options.
.PP
There are no mandatory options.
.PP
Options may be predefined in the environment variable \fBCW_OPTIONS\fP.
If defined, these options are used first; command line options take
precedence.
.PP

.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.PP
\fBcw\fP reads characters from an input file, or from standard input, and
sounds each valid character as Morse code on either the system sound card,
or the system console speaker.  After it sounds a character, \fBcw\fP
echoes it to standard output.  The input stream can contain embedded
command strings.  These change the parameters used when sounding the
Morse code.
\fBcw\fP reports any errors in embedded commands on standard error.
.PP
Use 'Ctrl+D' key combination to exit \fBcw\fP.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.\"
\fBcw\fP understands the following command line options.  The long
form options may not be available in non-LINUX versions.
.TP
.I "\-s, \-\-system=SYSTEM"
Specifies the way that \fBcw\fP generates tones.  Valid values
are:
\fInull\fP for no tones, just timings,
\fIconsole\fP for tones through the console speaker,
\fIalsa\fP for tones generated through the system sound card using ALSA
sound system,
\fIoss\fP for tones generated through system sound card using OSS sound
system,
\fIpulseaudio\fP for tones generated through system sound card using
PulseAudio sound system,
\fIsoundcard\fP for tones generated through the system sound card, but
without explicit selection of sound system. These values can be
shortened to 'n', 'c', 'a', 'o', 'p', or 's', respectively. The default
value is 'pulseaudio' (on systems with PulseAudio installed), followed
by 'oss'.
.TP
.I "\-d, \-\-device=DEVICE"
Specifies the device file to open for generating a sound.
\fBcw\fP will use default device if none is specified. The default
devices are:
\fI/dev/console\fP for sound produced through console,
\fIdefault\fP for ALSA sound system,
\fI/dev/audio\fP for OSS sound system,
\fIa default device\fP for PulseAudio sound system.
See also \fINOTES ON USING A SOUND CARD\fP below.
.TP
.I "\-w, \-\-wpm=WPM"
Sets the initial sending speed in words per minute.  The value must be
between 4 and 60.  The default value is 12 WPM.
.TP
.I "\-t, \-\-tone=HZ"
Sets the initial sounder pitch in Hz.  This value must be between 0
and 4,000.  A value of 0 selects silent operation, and can be used for
timing checks or other testing.  The default value is 800Hz,
.TP
.I "\-v, \-\-volume=PERCENT"
Sets the initial sending volume, as a percentage of full scale volume.
The value must be between 0 and 100.  The default value is 70 %.
Sound volumes work fully for sound card tones, but \fBcw\fP cannot
control the volume of tones from the console speaker.  In this case,
a volume of zero is silent, and all other volume values are simply sounded.
.TP
.I "\-g, \-\-gap=GAP"
Sets the initial extra gap, in dot lengths, between characters
(the 'Farnsworth' delay).  It must be between 0 and 60.  The default
is 0.
.TP
.I "\-k, \-\-weighting=WEIGHT"
Sets the initial weighting, as a percentage of dot lengths.  It must be
between 20 and 80.  The default is 50.
.TP
.I "\-e, \-\-noecho"
Stops \fBcw\fP echoing characters on standard output after they are
sounded.  The default is to have echoing on.
.TP
.I "\-m, \-\-nomessages"
Stops \fBcw\fP printing error messages on standard error.
The default is to print messages.
.TP
.I "\-c, \-\-nocommands"
Stops \fBcw\fP from interpreting commands embedded in the input stream.
The default is to interpret embedded commands.
.TP
.I "\-o, \-\-nocombinations"
Stops \fBcw\fP from treating character strings bracketed by [...] as
a single combination character.  The default is to honor combinations.
.TP
.I "\-p, \-\-nocomments"
Stops \fBcw\fP from treating character strings bracketed by {...}
as 'comments'.  Characters inside these braces will be echoed to standard
output, but not sounded.  When comments are being honored, any
embedded commands inside the braces will be ignored.  The default is
to honor comments.
.TP
.I "\-f, \-\-infile=FILE"
Specifies a text file that \fBcw\fP can read to configure its practice
text.
.TP
.I "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints short help message.
.TP
.I "\-V, \-\-version"
Prints information about program's version, authors and license.
.PP

.SS SOUNDING CHARACTERS
.\"
\fBcw\fP reads characters, one at a time, from its standard input or
from its input file.  Lowercase letters are converted internally to
uppercase. The following list shows the valid IS0 8859-1 (Latin-1)
characters that can be sounded by \fBcw\fP:
.\" \[u0022] = ", otherwise emacs syntax highlighting is messed up;
.IP
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\[u0022]$()+\-./:;=?_@ and space
.PP
In addition, the program also understands the following ISO 8859-1
and ISO 8859-2 accented characters:
.\"
.\"
.\" �������Ѫ�
.\"
.\"
.\" This looks like a great place for tutorial on non-standard characters
.\" in troff document tutorial ;)
.\"
.\" Q: how to produce '�' ('S' with Cedilla)?
.\" A: use composite glyph; 'man 7 groff_char' gives this syntax of
.\"    composite glyph:
.\"    \[base_glyph composite_1 composite_2 ...]
.\"    For '�' base glyph is 'S', and first (and only) composite is
.\"    'cedilla', represented by Unicode thingy 'u0327'. Thus:
.\"    '�' = '\[S u0327]';
.\"
.\" Q: how to produce '�' ('Z' with caron/hacek)?
.\" A: in two ways: either as a composite glyph as demonstrated above),
.\"    i.e. like this: '\[Z u030C]', or in 'regular' way, using
.\"    non-composite glyph \[vZ]'
.\"
.\" Q: any more tips?
.\" A: two:
.\"    - read 'man 7 groff_char' (or 'man 7 troff_char');
.\"    - make sure that your terminal (terminal emulator) can display
.\"      non-standard characters correctly (and I mean *really* correctly);
.\"      make a little test: open 'man 7 troff_char' in your terminal,
.\"      and open web page with html version of the man page, then search
.\"      for non-standard characters (e.g. cedilla) in the html document
.\"      and compare them with those displayed in the terminal;
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.IP
\[:U]\[:A]\[,C]\[:O]\['E]\[`E]\[`A]\[~N]\[S u0327] (S with cedilla), \[vZ] (Z with caron/hacek),
.PP
and accepts the following as single character forms of common procedural
signals:
.IP
<>!&^~
.PP
See \fBcw\fP(7,LOCAL) for more information on the above characters
and Morse code.
.PP
If \fBcw\fP receives a character not in this set, it prints an error
message '?\fIc\fP', where \fIc\fP is the error character.  The only
exceptions to this may be the \fBcw\fP command escape character '%',
the combination start and stop characters '[' and ']', and the
comment start and stop characters '{' and '}'.
See \fIEMBEDDED COMMANDS\fP and \fIMORSE CODE COMBINATIONS\fP below.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS EMBEDDED COMMANDS
.\"
\fBcw\fP recognizes special sequences in the input stream as embedded
commands.  These commands alter the parameters of the \fBcw\fP while it is
running, or query current values.  All commands are prefixed by the
command escape character '%', and those which set a value end with a
semicolon.
.PP
The format of an embedded command to change a parameter value is
.IP
%\fICvalue\fP;
.PP
where \fIC\fP is a command letter indicating what action \fBcw\fP
is to take, and \fIvalue\fP is the argument or value for the command.
.PP
Valid command letters are
.TP
.I "T"
Sets the tone pitch used to sound a character.
.TP
.I "W"
Sets the sending speed.
.TP
.I "G"
Sets the 'Farnsworth' gap between characters.
.TP
.I "K"
Sets the weighting.
.TP
.I "E"
Disables or re-enables echoing of sent characters on standard output.
.TP
.I "M"
Disables or re-enables error messages on standard error.
.TP
.I "S"
Disables or re-enables speaker tone generation.
.TP
.I "C"
Disables processing of embedded commands.  Note that once disabled,
this command cannot re-enable them.
.TP
.I "O"
Disables or re-enables recognition of [...] character combinations.
.TP
.I "P"
Disables or re-enables recognition of {...} comments.  When comments
are being recognized, any character after an opening '{' and before
any closing '}' will be echoed to standard output, but will not be
sounded, or have any other effect.
.PP
For example, the embedded command sequence
.IP
%W25;%T1200;
.PP
will set \fBcw\fP to a speed of 25 WPM, and a tone pitch of 1200Hz.
.PP
The 'T', 'W', 'G', and 'A' commands take values along with the command.
The limits on values given for embedded commands are the same as the
limits available for command line options, detailed above.
.PP
The 'E', 'M', 'S', 'C' and 'O' commands are flags, and treat a value of
zero as clear, and any other value as set.  So, for example, the sequence
.IP
%M0;%C0;
.PP
will turn off error messages, and then turn off the processing of
embedded commands.
.PP
If a parameter is set successfully, \fBcw\fP reports the new setting on
standard error (except if no error messages is set).  If an error is
detected in an embedded command, \fBcw\fP reports an error.  For the
formats of error messages see the \fIMESSAGE FORMATS\fP section below.
.PP
The current values of parameters within \fBcw\fP may be queried,
as well as set.  The command format
.IP
%?\fIC\fP
.PP
queries the value of the parameter normally set with command \fIC\fP.
.B cw
reports the current value on standard error, using the same format
as when new values are set.
.PP
The current values of parameters within \fBcw\fP may also be requested
as output in Morse code.  The command format
.IP
%>\fIC\fP
.PP
will generate Morse output reporting the value of the parameter
normally set with command \fIC\fP.
.PP
If embedded commands are disabled, '%' characters are treated as any
other (in this case, invalid) input character.
.PP
Once processing of embedded commands has been switched off, any
command to switch this feature back on will not be recognized.  That
is, after '%C0;', an '%C1;' will not be recognized.
.PP
There is one additional command, and that is '%Q'.  This command
closes all open files and terminates \fBcw\fP.  Any characters after
this command in the input stream will be lost.
.PP
The file \fIcw.h\fP provides a full set of definitions for the
commands, special characters, and status codes of \fBcw\fP.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS MESSAGE FORMATS
.\"
Where a parameter value is set correctly with an embedded command, the
message format
.IP
\=\fICvalue\fP
.PP
is returned.  \fIC\fP is the command used, and \fIvalue\fP is the
new value.
.PP
If an invalid value is supplied for a parameter in an embedded
command, a message
.IP
?\fICvalue\fP
.PP
is returned.
.PP
Where an invalid command is encountered, the message format
.IP
?%\fIC\fP
.PP
is used.  For an invalid query, the message is
.IP
??\fIC\fP
.PP
and for an invalid request for a parameter in Morse code the message
is
.IP
?>\fIC\fP
.PP
A character in the input stream that cannot be sounded produces a
message
.IP
?\fIC\fP
.PP
These messages are not intended to be user-friendly, but are designed
to be easily and quickly interpreted by another program.  Similarly,
the format of embedded commands is more computer-friendly than
user-friendly.
.PP
If error messages are disabled, no messages of any type are printed on
standard error.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS MORSE CODE COMBINATIONS
.\"
The standard set of characters offered by \fBcw\fP may not be sufficient
for some purposes.  For example, some international characters do not have
equivalent ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2 that \fBcw\fP can sound directly.
.PP
To help in sounding such characters, \fBcw\fP offers the ability to form
combination characters by placing individual character components
between [...] brackets.  \fBCw\fP sounds characters inside a combination
without the usual gap between them.  In this way, any missing character
in the set can be built.
.PP
For example
.IP
[VA]
.PP
is one way to form the VA procedural signal, though
.IP
[SK]
.PP
works just as well.  The eight-dot error signal can be sounded with
.IP
[HSE]
.PP
or the C-cedilla in international Morse code with
.IP
[CE]
.PP
There can be as many valid letters, numbers, or figures inside the [...]
brackets as required.  For example, an alternative way of sending the
error signal could be
.IP
[EEEEEEEE]
.PP
Finally, three alternative ways of sending 73 might be
.IP
[TTEEE][EEETT]
.br
[TDE][EUT]
.br
[GEE][VT]
.PP
Embedded commands may be placed inside [...] combinations if required.
Combinations do not nest.
.PP
This feature can be disabled by using the \fI\-O\fP
or \fI\-\-nocombinations\fP command line flags, or with the 'O' embedded
command.  If combinations are disabled, '[' and ']' characters are treated
as any other (invalid) input character.
.PP

.SS NOTES ON USING A SOUND CARD
.\"
By default, \fBcw\fP tries to open default PulseAudio. If PulseAudio
server is not accessible, cw tries to open OSS device "/dev/audio" to access
the system sound card.  This is generally the correct device to use,
but for systems with special requirements, or those with multiple sound
cards, the option \fI-d\fP or \fI\-\-device\fP, combined with
\fI-s\fP or \fI\-\-system\fP can be used to specify the device
and audio system for sound card access.  If the sound card device
cannot be set up, \fBcw\fP prints the error message
.IP
cannot set up soundcard sound
.PP
and exits.
.PP
Sound card devices, when opened through OSS sound system, are usually
single-access devices, so that when one process has opened the device,
other processes are prevented from using it. In such cases \fBcw\fP
will of course conflict with any other programs that expect exclusive
use of the system sound card (for example, MP3 players).
If \fBcw\fP finds that the sound card is already busy, it prints the
error message
.IP
open /dev/audio: Device or resource busy
.PP
and exits.
.PP
.\" The main sound card device will often allow \fBcw\fP to control tone
.\" volumes directly, but where this is not possible, \fBcw\fP uses the
.\" mixer device instead.  By default, this is "/dev/mixer", but the device
.\" can be specified with the \fI-y\fP or \fI\-\-mdevice\fP options.  In
.\" general, as with the main sound card device, the default mixer device
.\" is usually the correct one to use.
.\" .PP
.\" The mixer device is only used if the sound card does not allow volume
.\" control through the main sound card device.
.PP
The sound card device is not used if \fBcw\fP is only sending tones on
the console speaker.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS AUDIO OUTPUT \- DEFAULTS AND SELECTION
.\"
\fBcw\fP first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound system,
using default device name, unless user specifies other audio device with
option \fI-d\fP or \fI\-\-device\fP.
.PP
\fBcw\fP then tries to access sound card using OSS audio system
and default OSS audio device name ('/dev/audio'), unless user
specifies other audio device with option \fI-d\fP or \fI\-\-device\fP.
.PP
If opening soundcard through OSS fails, \fBcw\fP tries to access
the sound card using ALSA audio system, and default ALSA audio device
name ('default'), unless user specifies other audio device with option
\fI-d\fP or \fI\-\-device\fP.
.PP
If opening soundcard through ALSA also fails, \fBcw\fP tries to access
system console buzzer using default buzzer device '/dev/console',
unless user specifies other audio device with option \fI-d\fP or
\fI\-\-device\fP.
.PP
It is very common that in order to access the console buzzer device
user has to have root privileges.  For that reason trying to open
console buzzer almost always fails.  This is not a program's bug,
this is a result of operating system's restrictions.
Making \fBcw\fP an suid binary bypasses this restriction.  The program
does not fork() or exec(), so making it suid should be relatively safe.
Note however that this practice is discouraged for security reasons.
.PP
As stated, user can tell \fBcw\fP which device to use, using
\fI-d\fP or \fI\-\-device\fP option.  Which device files are suitable
will depend on which operating system is running, which system
user ID runs \fBcw\fP, and which user groups user belongs to.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTES
.\"
Despite the fact that this manual page constantly and consistently
refers to Morse code elements as dots and dashes, DO NOT think in these
terms when trying to learn Morse code.  Always think of them as 'dit's
and 'dah's.
.PP
The Morse code table in the \fBcw\fP(7,LOCAL) man page is provided for
reference only.  If learning for the first time, you will be much better
off learning by hearing the characters sent, rather than by looking at
the table.
.PP
Other programs running in the system may interfere with the timing of
the Morse code that \fBcw\fP is sending.  If this is a problem,
either try to run on a quiescent system, or try running \fBcw\fP
with nice(1L,C,1).  UNIX is not really designed for user-level programs
to do the sort of fine timing required to send Morse code.  \fBcw\fP
is therefore more sensitive than most programs to other system activity.
.PP
.B cw
uses system itimers for its internal timing.  On most UNIX flavors,
itimers are not guaranteed to signal a program exactly at the specified
time, and they generally offer a resolution only as good as the normal
system 'clock tick' resolution.  An itimer SIGALRM usually falls on a
system clock tick, making it accurate to no better than 10mS on a typical
100Hz kernel.
.PP
The effect of this is that an itimer period is generally either
exactly as specified, or, more likely, slightly longer.  At higher
WPM settings, the cumulative effect of this affects timing accuracy,
because at higher speeds, there are fewer 10mS clock ticks in a dot
period.  For example, at 12 WPM, the dot length is 100mS, enough to
contain five kernel clock ticks.  But at 60 WPM, the dot length is 20mS,
or just two kernel clock ticks.  So at higher speeds, the effect of itimer
resolutions becomes more pronounced.
.PP
To test itimer timing, first try
.IP
X="PARIS PARIS PARIS PARIS "
.IP
echo "$X" | time cw \-w 4
.PP
and note the elapsed time, which should be very close to one minute.
Next, try
.IP
echo "$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X" | time cw \-w 48
.PP
The elapsed time should be the same.  If it has increased, this is the
effect of system itimers delaying for slightly longer than the specified
period (higher WPM rates make more itimer calls).  That's itimers for you,
not perfect for this job, but the best there is without writing some,
and perhaps a lot of, kernel code.
.PP
Except for zero, which is silent, tone values lower than 10Hz may not
sound at the expected pitch.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES

Send a string of characters at 25 WPM, 700Hz, with no extra gaps:
.IP
echo "UNIX CW SOUNDER" | cw \-w 25 \-t 700
